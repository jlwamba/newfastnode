# mynewfastnode
Step-by-step

By the way, I committed the Cardinal Sin of Coding when making this exam. I just opened up my IDE and started writing the code without writing down what I was doing. Pretty soon I had a mess of files and functions and code all over the place.

download the <source code> from my ghyt repo my-super-cool-awesome-project-app-heroku-node-thing
HINT: You should be able to locate it even without a direct link
open up the project in your IDE
locally install all necessary project dependencies (hint: look at the package.json)
delete the demofile.txt
modify user.json to include the following:
{
    "name": "your name",
    "github": "your github username",
    "repo" : "url to the repo you create for this code", 
    "app" : "url to the heroku app you create for this", 
    "skills" : ["skill 1", "skill 2", "skill 3", "skill ...n" ]
}
modify the angular.html file to display the user.json data IN WITH THE HTML
that's all five "keys" (from name to skills) and list all your skills
remove excess code, tags (e.g., <input>, comments. Make the code your own
test the app locally
create a new github repo
update the repo with your modified <source code>
deploy the code using heroku
update github about with the heroku app link
update your user.json with the updated "repo:" & "app" urls
